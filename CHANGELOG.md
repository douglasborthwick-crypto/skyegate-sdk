# Changelog

## 0.4.6

- `proveWalletOwnership` takes `walletType`: `'evm'` (default), `'solana'`, `'sui'` or `'tron'`. A
  non-EVM wallet signs the challenge through `signMessage`, which may return the wallet's own format:
  a `Uint8Array` or base64 string for Solana, the `signature` string for Sui, the hex string for Tron.
- Documentation: which wallets prove ownership, and that XRP Ledger, Bitcoin and Stellar wallets are
  refused by a licensed gate.

## 0.4.5

- `validateContentToken` matches `expectedConditions` against the whole signed result. The EAS
  `template` shorthand (`coinbase_verified_account`, `coinbase_verified_country`, `coinbase_one`,
  `gitcoin_passport_score`, `gitcoin_passport_active`) is checked through what it resolves to, and an
  unknown template never matches. `label` is compared with the signed label (NFC), `chainId` accepts a
  number or numeric string, addresses compare case-insensitively, and `decimals` is ignored because it
  is never signed. An `nft_ownership` expectation matches the signed "holds at least one". Conditions
  written exactly as documented now pass.
- The Gitcoin templates are told apart by their signed decoder method; a verdict that does not carry
  one does not match either template.
- The post-quantum companion loads under Next.js (webpack and Turbopack) and Vite: the optional
  `@noble/post-quantum` import is left to the runtime instead of being replaced by the bundler.
- The companion must be signed by the attestation key (`insumer-attest-pq1`); a companion under any
  other key is refuted. A malformed companion (a JSON `null` header, a non-string value) is reported
  as refuted instead of throwing.
- `verifyConditions` always returns `error` as a string, including the `{ code, message }` errors the
  API passes through. A response that carries no signed verdict is an error, never a "not met".
- `validateContentToken` accepts only InsumerAPI's attestation signing keys for the JWT (`insumer-attest-v1`,
  `insumer-attest-v2`; override with `allowedKids`), and reports an invalid `pqRequiredFrom` as an error on every
  call instead of throwing. A "pass" that arrives without a token is treated as no verdict.
- `walletType` adds `'xrpl'`, `'bitcoin'`, `'tron'`, `'stellar'` and `'sui'`.
- `<GatedContent>` takes an optional `errorFallback`, so an outage or license problem can look
  different from "not met". Without it, behaviour is unchanged.
- Documentation: leave `decimals` out; what `expectedConditions` checks; the chain families.
